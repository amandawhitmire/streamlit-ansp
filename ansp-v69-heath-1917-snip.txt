THE ANATOMY OF AN EOLID, CHIORAERA DALLI. BY HAROLD HEATH.

In 1852 Gould described a species of nudibranch, dredged in three fathoms of water at Fort Discovery, Puget Sound, establishing for it a new genus, Chioraera, whose translated diagnosis is as follows: Body limaciform, head very large, pedunculate, semiglobose. The species is further characterized by a pearly and whitish-colored body finely reticulated with orange. The total length of the body is five and one-fourth inches. 

Some habitats we know are in the json file are near large rocks, near river mouths, near the bottom and near the ocean.

Some species names are Hemigrapsus affinis, Hemigrapsus crassimanus, Hendersonia alternifoliae and Hendersonia celtifolia.

On the 26th of July, 1913, I collected a number of specimens of what appear to be a new species of this genus in Rose Inlet on the eastern shore of Dall Island in southeastern Alaska. Two days later a few other individuals were taken in Hecate Strait near Hetta on the western coast of Prince of Wales Island. To Mr. W. F. Thompson I am indebted for additional material collected at Echo Harbor and Sewell Inlet on the eastern coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands.
