THE ANATOMY OF AN EOLID, CHIORAERA DALLI. BY HAROLD HEATH.

In 1852 Gould described a species of nudibranch, dredged in three fathoms of water at Fort Discovery, Puget Sound, establishing for it a new genus, Chioraera, whose translated diagnosis is as follows: Body limaciform, head very large, pedunculate, semiglobose; oral face ventral, discoidal; mouth longitudinal, surrounded by a double series of cirri; cephalic tentacles foliate, retractile; branchial folds fan-shaped, arranged in a series on each side; genital opening removed from the almost dorsal anus. The species is further characterized by a pearly and whitish-colored body finely reticulated with orange. The cirri likewise are orange colored, and the cephalic tentacles are capable of retraction within a special sheath. The total length of the body is five and one-fourth inches. 

On the 26th of July, 1913, I collected a number of specimens of what appear to be a new species of this genus in Rose Inlet on the eastern shore of Dall Island in southeastern Alaska. Two days later a few other individuals were taken in Hecate Strait near Hetta on the western coast of Prince of Wales Island. To Mr. W. F. Thompson I am indebted for additional material collected at Echo Harbor and Sewell Inlet on the eastern coast of the Queen Charlotte Islands.
