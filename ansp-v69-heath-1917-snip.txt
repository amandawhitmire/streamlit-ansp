THE ANATOMY OF AN EOLID, CHIORAERA DALLI. BY HAROLD HEATH.

In 1852 Gould described a species of nudibranch, dredged in three fathoms of water at Fort Discovery, Puget Sound, establishing for it a new genus, Chioraera, whose translated diagnosis is as follows: Body limaciform, head very large, pedunculate, semiglobose. 

Some habitats we know are in the json file are near large rocks, back-reefs, and swampy jungle. Some species names to look at are Pagurus decorus, Hemigrapsus crassimanus, and Hendersonia celtifolia.

On the 26th of July, 1913, I collected a number of specimens of what appear to be a new species of this genus in Rose Inlet on the eastern shore of Dall Island in southeastern Alaska. Two days later a few other individuals were taken in Hecate Strait near Hetta on the western coast of Prince of Wales Island.
